# Summary

There are different organisations who work on advancement of research. Research
is the base for any implementation made available for use. We have researched the
Journals for Mathematics, Distributed Computing, Operating System, Statistics
and Operating System Journals for this research paper. We have an implementation where
we suggest how we can make research more fun and accessible for the users. Given
a topic user can read more papers. The user can read papers and filter based on
topics, tags, publisher. We are publishing a GIF maker tool for research papers
which summarise the implementation and creates visual implementation based on
the research paper. We are publishing multiple repositories with this research paper.
We are publish a poll where we have asked people interested in reading and focused on research
about what they feel inhibits them in advancing in distributed environment. As
future work we will publishing one website where research will be animated and
visually presented suggesting the users on what they would like reading and exploring.
